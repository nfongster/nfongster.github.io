    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in the American Midwest and raised in the beautiful Tri-Cities, Washington.
        Since then I've been working and studying in Seattle.  My educational 
        trajectory has had some twists and turns, but I've picked up many useful
        computational skills along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my coding knowledge was attained through various research projects.  As a junior in college, I worked on
        the <a href="https://www.katrin.kit.edu/68.php">KATRIN</a> experiment through UW's
        <a href="https://www.npl.washington.edu/">CENPA</a>, an experiment whose goal is to place a tighter bound on the neutrino's mass.
        My project involved validating an upgrade to KATRIN's muon veto, and 
        I began to pick up some basic
        C++ using <a href="https://root.cern.ch/">ROOT</a>, a software library that CERN 
        developed for processing particle physics data.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of my junior year, I began working as a research assistant at the UWMC
        <a href="https://radiationoncology.uw.edu/">Dept of Radiation Oncology</a> with some 
        of the medical physicists.  I had a wonderful experience and learned a lot, teaching 
        myself MATLAB for a quality-assurance project, as well as Python for 
        developing some <a href="https://www.raysearchlabs.com/raystation/">Raystation</a>
        scripts.  I was also very fortunate to contribute to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777595">paper</a>
        on a novel IMRT technique for low-income countries.  Many of the challenges I faced while 
        working on these projects encouraged me to develop my computational skills further, so I 
        decided to pursue graduate studies in applied mathematics.
    </p>

        While in college, I also worked as a physics tutor at 
        <a href="https://webster.uaa.washington.edu/asp/website/clue/home/">CLUE</a>, one of
        UW's Academic Support Programs.  This was also a great experience because I had the 
        opportunity to help students learn good study habits 
        and understand difficult concepts.  I also lead exam reviews and was hired as lead physics 
        tutor during my final year on the job, a role in which I was responsible for training new tutors,
        scheduling exam reviews, and hiring new tutors for the following year.  Through tutoring
        I learned to interact with a wide variety of people, summarize difficult concepts, and present 
        material in front of audiences as large as 180 people.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to intern at the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/">Allen Institute for Brain Science</a>,
        where I worked on a data science project classifying axon and dendrite terminal morphology.
        I gained even more technical skills, working with various Python libraries (Numpy,
        Pandas, sklearn, skimage), running neural networks using PyTorch, and writing some C++/bash
        scripts in a Linux environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've learned quite a lot these past few years and I am excited to see where my career will go next.  I enjoy self-studying and picking up new skills as I encounter new problems.
        If your group is looking for computational support from a self-learner, check out my resume and send me an email - I'd love to hear from you!
