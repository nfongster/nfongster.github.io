        When time and money permit, I enjoy checking out local places to grab a drink or a bite to eat.  Here's a compilation
        of some places I've frequented.  I should mention that most of these are in or within a 30 minute bus ride from the U
        District - such is life as a UW student.

        <h3>Breweries</h3>
        <p>
            Seattle is known for its local breweries.  If you're visiting
            and need ideas, here's a list of some breweries I like, in no 
            particular order:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.ravennabrewing.com/" target="_blank">Ravenna Brewing</a> - located in a residential
                area and has excellent porters and a wide selection of IPAs and sours (if you're into
                that sort of thing).
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.fremontbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Fremont Brewing Co.</a> - great outdoor seating with a family-friendly environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://uvillage.com/ram-restaurant-brewery/" target="_blank">The Ram</a> - actually a restaurant chain with on-site brewing, but it's good.  This is a link to the U Village one.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.burkegilmanbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Burke Gilman Brewing Co.</a> - just off the famous Burke Gilman
                trail, has a wide selection of all types of beers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="restaurants">
        <h3>Restaurants</h3>
        <p>
            There are also lots of good restaurants in Seattle.  Here's another
            list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.shultzys.com/menus" target="_blank">Schultzy's</a> - Personally my favorite place on the Ave.  Lots of
                German lagers and ridiculously good food as well.  A great spot for good drinks, good food, and good conversation
                with friends late at night.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://zeekspizza.com/" target="_blank">Zeek's Pizza</a> - chain with many locations in and around Seattle.  I have
                personally only been to the Ravenna site, but the pizza is some of the best I've had, and they have a good selection of drinks
                as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://eurekarestaurantgroup.com/locations/seattle-u-village/" target="_blank">Eureka!</a> - One of my all-time favorite restaurants in Seattle.  Amazing all-American food
                and a very extensive list of beers and hard alcohol, mostly from various places along the west coast.  A bit pricey, but worth it in my opinion.  Also, it's a chain,
                so there are other locations throughout the US as well; I've linked the U Village location.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.tasteofindiaseattle.com/home/" target="_blank">Taste of India</a>,
                <a href="http://bengaltigerwa.com/" target="_blank">Bengal Tiger</a>
                - Really good Indian food.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://cedarsseattle.com/" target="_blank">Cedars</a> - Indian and Mediterranean food.  The servings are large, I almost always leave with leftovers!
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://sebisbistro.com/" target="_blank">Sebi's Bistro</a> - Great Polish food!
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://cafe-turko.com/" target="_blank">Cafe Turko</a> - Great Turkish food/coffee/tea!
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://getyourhotcakes.com/" target="_blank">Hot Cakes</a> - If you need a warm and tasty dessert, this is the place for you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.piebarballard.com/" target="_blank">Pie Bar</a> - If you need a warm dessert AND a drink, this is the place for you.

        <h3>Tea</h3>
        <p>

    </div>
