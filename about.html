    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I was born in the American Midwest and raised in the beautiful Tri-Cities, Washington.
        Since then I've been working and studying in Seattle.  My educational 
        trajectory has had some twists and turns, but I've picked up many useful
        computational skills along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my coding knowledge was acquired through various research projects.  As a junior in college, I worked on
        the <a href="https://www.katrin.kit.edu/68.php" target="_blank">KATRIN</a> experiment through UW's
        <a href="https://www.npl.washington.edu/" target="_blank">CENPA</a>, an experiment whose goal is to place a tighter bound on the neutrino's mass.
        My project involved validating an upgrade to KATRIN's muon veto, and 
        I began to pick up some basic
        C++ using <a href="https://root.cern.ch/" target="_blank">ROOT</a>, a software library that CERN 
        developed for processing particle physics data.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of my junior year, I began working as a research assistant at the UWMC
        <a href="https://radiationoncology.uw.edu/research/" target="_blank">Department of Radiation Oncology</a> with some 
        of the medical physicists.  I had a wonderful experience and learned a lot, teaching 
        myself MATLAB for a quality-assurance project, as well as Python for 
        developing some <a href="https://www.raysearchlabs.com/raystation/" target="_blank">Raystation</a>
        scripts.  I also contributed to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777595" target="_blank">paper</a>
        on a novel IMRT technique for low-income countries, recognized as one of <em>Physics World</em>'s
        <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/discovery-of-magic-angle-graphene-that-behaves-like-a-high-temperature-superconductor-is-physics-world-2018-breakthrough-of-the-year/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=iop&utm_term=&utm_campaign=14290-40670&utm_content=Top%20Ten%20Breakthroughs%20of%202018" target="_blank">
            Top-Ten Breakthroughs of 2018</a>.
        Many of the challenges I faced while working on these projects encouraged me to further develop my computational skills, leading me 
        to pursue graduate studies in applied mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the summer of 2019, I did an internship at the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/" target="_blank">Allen Institute for Brain Science</a>
        where I worked on a data science project classifying axon and dendrite terminal morphology.
        I gained even more technical skills, working with various Python libraries (Numpy,
        Pandas, sklearn, skimage), running neural networks using PyTorch, and writing some C++/bash
        scripts in a Linux environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've learned quite a lot these past few years and I am excited to see where my career will go next.  I enjoy self-studying and picking up new skills as I encounter new problems.
        If your group is looking for computational support from a self-learner, check out my résumé and send me an email - I'd love to hear from you!
